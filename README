WHAT IS JKSEngine?
=======================================================================

JKSEngine is a project consisting of two programs enabling OpenSSL to
use Java Keystores. One part of the project is an OpenSSL Engine called
JKSEngine and the other part is a Java connector tool called ConnJKSEngine.
Additional information can be found within the README files of
the appropriate program folders.


HOW TO INSTALL
=======================================================================

JKSEngine as well as ConnJKSEngine can be standardized compiled and 
installed with the included makefile.

$ cd <JKSEngine Toplevel Source Directory>
$ make 
$ make install

Furthermore each if the two parts of JKSEngine is delievered with an
own makefile. Therefore, it can be compiled for itself and installed
in individual directories


HOW TO USE
=======================================================================

Usage details are presented within the README file of JKSEngine itself.
If you execute the overall makefile the two programs will be installed
in standard directories and you do not need to initialize path
parameters within the engine.
